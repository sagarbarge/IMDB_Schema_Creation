IMDb Schema Creation using provided data

# Problem Statement
In this optional assignment, you will be given an Excel file which contains the ERD and data values for an 'IMDb' dataset. 
You will use this extensively during your graded assignment after the module on Advanced SQL and Best Practices. 
You will also look at a detailed problem statement in the assignment.
For now, try to create the tables and insert the values for the entire schema in your workbench.
