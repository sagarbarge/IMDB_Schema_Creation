# IMDB_Schema_Creation
To create an IMDB schema, begin by defining the primary tables representing core entities like Movies, Actors, Directors, and Genres. Each table should include relevant attributes, such as movie titles, release dates, actor names, and genre types. Establish relationships between these entities using foreign keys, for example, linking movies to actors and directors via join tables like Movie_Actors and Movie_Directors. Indexes on key columns will optimize query performance, and constraints will enforce data integrity.

# Objective
IMDB Schema Creation using provided data to allowing efficient storage, retrieval, and analysis of movie-related data.
